A Monocular Vision-Based Localization System of Size-Uncertain Ground Targets for UAVs

This is the source code of our paper "A Monocular Vision-Based Localization System for Size-Undetermined Ground Targets for UAVs". This file consists of three parts: 
1. gimbal_servoing: contains related codes such as gimbal visual servoing tracking 
2. mono: contains codes related to target object localization methods 
3. yolov5_new: target object detection codes based on yoloV5
